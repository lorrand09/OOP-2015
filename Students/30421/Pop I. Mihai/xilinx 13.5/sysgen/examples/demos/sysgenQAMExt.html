<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">A QAM system with packet framing and FEC for
telemetry channels</font></h3>
<p>
This design implements a QAM system with packet framing and FEC for telemetry
channels.  
The system is implemented according to the specifications provided by the
Consultative 
Committee for Space Data Systems for telemetry channel coding specification 
(CCSDS 101.0-B-5).  
<p>

A sinusoidal source provides 8-bit samples to the 'FEC and QAM Symbol Mapping'
subsystem. 
Forward Error Correction (FEC) is applied to the samples and an attached
synchronization
marker (ASM) is asserted at the start of each code block.   The data is mapped
into 16-QAM 
symbols and then interpolated.  Doppler content, ISI, and white Guassian noise
are introduced
into the signal before it enters the receiver subsystem.  
<p>

The receiver employs a 16-QAM demodulator that performs adaptive channel
equalization
and carrier recovery on a QAM input source.  The ASM is stripped from the
demodulated data 
before concatenated FEC is applied.  A PicoBlaze microcontroller controls the RS
decoder, 
maintains frame alignment of the received packects, and performs periodic
adjustments of
the de-mapping QAM-16 quadrant reference.
