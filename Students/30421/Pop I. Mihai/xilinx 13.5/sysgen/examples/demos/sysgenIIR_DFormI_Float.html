<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">2nd-order Direct Form I implementation</font></h3>
<p>

This design example shows two distinct FPGA implementations of a 2nd order IIR
filter in Direct Form I, 
and compares them to the double precision Simulink IIR filter block.

<p>
The FPGA_FIXED_SUBSYSTEM is an IIR block 'IIIR_FIXED which is implemented with data input set to Fix32_27;
coefficients use 32 bit with 30 bits fractional and the adder tree usesFix32_24 notation

<p>
The FPGA_FLOAT_SUBSYSTEM is an IIR block 'IIIR_FLOAT which is implemented using floating point block with custom
precision with exponent set to 7 bits and the fractional set to 20 bits
Therefore data and coefficients use Float_7_20

<p>
Multiple display blocks allow the user to visualize the Power Spectrum  Density (PSD) of each 
implementation as well as the quantization error in the DISPLAY block.

<p>
The input is a sine wave with random noise added. if the random noise is small the fixed implementation gives good results 
but as the dynamic range is increased the floating point implementation is better and when compared with an error window 
the fixed implemenation is alway outside the error window.

</p>

<p>

All the variables such as data width, coefficient width, Sample period, and coefficient values are 
initialized in the sysgenIIR_DFormI_Float_PreLoadFcn.m file. 
</p>

<p>

A separate counter system is added to create multi cycle paths. The counter is running at the highest rate
and this forces System Generator  to create a CE for the IIR logic which is running at multiple of  the 
FPGA clock rate.
