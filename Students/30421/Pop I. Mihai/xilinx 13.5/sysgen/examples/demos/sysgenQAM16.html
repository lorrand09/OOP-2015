<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">16-QAM demodulator</font></h3>
<p>
This design implements an equalized 16-QAM demodulator for use in a software
defined 
radio.  The receiver architecture provides subsystems that demonstrate adaptive
channel 
equalization and carrier tracking on a random QAM data source.  
<p>
In addition to the System Generator demodulator components, the model includes
Simulink 
subsystems that introduce channel effects and Doppler content into the data
source.  Scopes 
are provided at important nodes for analysis purposes.  The operation of
receiver is best 
illustrated with a long simulation duration, so that the points in the
de-rotated constellation
have sufficient time to converge.
