<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">CORDIC-based divider circuit</font></h3>
<p>
This design implements a divider circuit using a fully parallel CORDIC
(COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm 
in linear vectoring mode with pre and post compensation. CORDIC based divider
converges for positive ratios till 2. ie. 
y <= 2x. Using the pre and post compensation circuit, this design can compute
any arbitrary ratio y/x.
</p>
<p>
The CORDIC algorithm is attractive for an FPGA implementation because it
consists primarily of shift and add operations.  
An N-bit adder/subtractor  requiries only N/2 logic slices.  The CORDIC Divider
subsystem is implemented for signed data
having width 16. The Divider circuit has been designed to converge for X and Y
between +/-  15.99951171875. The
Divider circuit does not converge if X or Y are equal to -16. The Divider
circuit can easily be modified for any bit precision.
With eleven PEs, the design occupies 1049 LUTs (17%), 1112 flip-flops (18%), 
645 slices (20%), and 1 dedicated multiplier of a Xilinx xc2v500-5 part.  
The maximum clock frequency is approximately 214.73 MHz 
(Device speed data version: PRODUCTION 1.121 2005-11-04, ISE 8.1i software, 
VHDL synthesized with XST).
