<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">Sysgen Floating Point FIR using M-Hardware Cosim</font></h3>
<p>
This model implements a transposed FIR filter with single precision floating point inputs. The floating 
point data is communicated to/from the FIR filter using the Shared FIFO based approach. 
</p>
<p>
The read enable on the input FIFO is asserted only when the FIFO is not empty. The write enable on the 
output FIFO is asserted when the FIFO is not full and the delayed read enable signal from the input FIFO is 
high. The delayed read enable signal is used from the input FIFO for synchronization with the output FIFO, 
when the subsytem is free-running in nature. This ensures that  the correct samples are read out from the 
output FIFO.

<p>
This model implements a transposed FIR filter with single precision floating point inputs. The floating 
point data is communicated to/from the FIR filter using the Shared FIFO based approach. 
</p>
<p>
The amount of delay required between the input and the output FIFO is equal to the clock cycles required by 
the subsystem to produce the first output + 1(delay from the FIFO). 
</p>
<p>
The subsystem also contains an enable input. This signal is used for synchronization in the internal circuitry. 
It ensures that the correct data samples are propagated through the internal circuitry only when there is valid
data in the input FIFO.
</p>
<p>
The FIR subsystem takes in the coefficients of the filters and implements a transposed FIR Filter. When the 
coefficients are given to the block, internally the 'sysgenFloatingPointFIRGenerator.m' script is run. This is 
used for programmatic generation of Xilinx based simulink blocks and models. Please refer the section on 
Programmatic Access in the SysGen User Guide for more details on Programmatic Generation API (PGAPI).  
</p>
<p>
The files for hardware cosimulation(.hwc, .mdl, .bit) with six tap FIR filter are provided along with this example
for SP-605 board. The M-hardware cosimulation script 'mhwcosim_fir_filter.m' will run the simulation on
hardware. According to the synchronization circuitry provided, each input sample in the input FIFO will provide a corresponding ouput 
sample on the output FIFO.  Sifting in zero input can be used to get the remaining data samples in the 
subsystem out.
