<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">Matrix inversion using Squared Givens Rotations</font></h3>
<p>
Matrix inversion is used in a variety of scenarious including adaptiove estimation,
beamforming etc. This design implements matrix inversion using floating point capability
in SysGen. Matrix inversion is realized by first triangularizing the input matrix
and then computing the inverse using backsubstition. Computation of matrix inversion
can therefore, be posed as follows:
<br>
<br>
A*X = I - (i)
<br>
<br>
T*A*X = TI -(ii)
<br>
<br>
Here we determine T such that T*A becomes an upper triangular matrix(U). 
The above equation therefore simplifies to :<br>
<br>
UX = TI - (iii)
<br>    
<br>    
Using (iii) it is possible to compute X using back substitution. This method of computing
the inverse is generally more stable than using the direct adjacent matrix approach. Many 
algorithms exist to find T including Givens Rotations. In this example we have adopted 
Squared Givens Rotations, a variation of Givens Rotation as described by R. Dohler, to 
perform triangularization of matrix A.

<p>
The model provided in this design consists of two Subsystems. SquaredGivensRotations performs
triangularization of the input matrix using the algorithm described in Reference 2.(See below).
This particular subsystem is programmatically generated using 
<b>sysgenMatrixInversSGRGeneration</b> script provided with this design. 
For more details on programmatic generation please refer to the section on 
<b>System Generator API for Programmatic Generation</b>
