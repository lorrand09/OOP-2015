<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">MIMO Channel Model Simulation
</font></h3>

<p>
This design demonstrates a Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) channel model.
The model parameters are based on four element linear transmit and receive 
arrays with flat fading.

<p>
The output scope shows the time domain channel response (real, imaginary, magnitude and phase).
