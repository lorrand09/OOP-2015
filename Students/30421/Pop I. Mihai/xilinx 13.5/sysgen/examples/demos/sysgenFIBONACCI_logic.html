<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">Logic and Cores Fibonacci
Number Generator</font></h3>
<p>
This design is a logic and cores implementation of a Fibonacci number generator.
That is, given a non-negative integer n, it computes the 
recursively defined sequence x_0 = 1, x_1 = 1, ... , x_n = x_{n-2} + x_{n-1}.
<p>
This design should be compared to sysgenFIBONACCI_synth which
implements the same computation in a more software-centric way.
The two designs are functionally equivalent, and use the same amount of FPGA resources.
