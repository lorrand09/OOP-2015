<p>
Virtually all digital receivers perform channel access using a digital
down-converter (DDC).  
<p>

The desired channel is translated to baseband using the digital mixer comprised 
of multipliers, M1 and M2, and a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).  The sample
rate of the
 signal is then adjusted to match the channel bandwidth.  This is performed
using a 
multi-stage multi-rate filter consisting of a CIC Filter and two polyphase
decimators.  The 
functions performed in the system are waveform synthesis (DDS), complex 
multiplication, and multirate filtering. The overall sample rate change of the
DDC is 192.
The DDS mixer signal has a spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 102dB. The data
rate 
can support up to 165 MSPS and is limited by the performance of the DDS Mixer.
