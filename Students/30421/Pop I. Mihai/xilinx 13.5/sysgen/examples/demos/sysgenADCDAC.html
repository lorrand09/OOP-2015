<p>
This model implements a 14-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) and a digital
to analog converter (DAC) for Virtex and Virtex derivative devices.  The model
is based on the delta-sigma DAC and ADC implementations described, 
respectively, in Xilinx App. Notes 154 and 155 by John Logue.  Both 
documents can be found at

The ADC requires feedback from the DAC to compute output samples.  The DAC
output is a pulse 
string whose duty cycle is proportional to the amplitude of the desired output
voltage.  XAPP154 
describes a low-pass filter on the DAC output implemented with an RC network.
Here the RC network
is simulated using a transfer function block.  XAPP155 specifies an op-amp
circuit on the input of
the ADC.  In this model, the op-amp is replaced by a relational block.

When simulating this model, the behavior is best viewed with the simulation
duration set to Inf.  The 
DAC input display shows the a binary representation of the DAC input and
illustrates the binary search
used by the ADC to constructs a digital sample of the input voltage (in this
case .73).

This design occupies 50 LUTs (13%), 63 flip-flops (16%), and 43 slices (22%)
of an xc2s15-6 part and runs at 183.89 MHz 
(Device speed data version: PRODUCTION 1.27 2005-11-04, ISE 8.1i software, 
VHDL synthesized with XST).
