<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">2nd-order Direct Form II implementation</font></h3>
<p>
This design example shows two distinct FPGA implementations of a 2nd order IIR
filter in Direct Form II, 
and compares them to the double precision Simulink IIR filter block.
<p>

IIR_Cmult is implemented using constant coefficient multipliers implemented in
LUTs, 
requiring 191 slices and running at 60 MHz in a XC2V80-6.
<p>

IIR_mult is implemented using embedded multipliers and uses 87 slices, 5
embedded 
multipliers and runs at 62 MHz in a XC2V80-6. This approach can only be used 
with the Virtex-II or Virtex-II Pro series FPGAs that provide the embedded
multipliers.
<p>

Multiple display blocks allow the user to visualize the Spectrum and Transfer
functions of each 
implementation as well as the quantization error in the DISPLAY block.  
<p>

All the variables such as data width, coefficient width, Sample period, and
coefficient values are 
initialized in the sysgenIIR_PreLoadFcn.m file. The default setting use 12 bit
data and coefficients
