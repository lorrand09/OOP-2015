<b>Triple Buffer</b>
<p>
This design implements a triple buffer controller that controls how frames are written to an external memory and read using a VDMA Interface.
</p>
<b>Design</b>
<p>
As the name suggests, triple buffer is a methodology used to synchronize data transfer between a writing device and reading device using three buffers. The writing device does not write to the buffer that is being used by the reading device. Instead the writing device write alternatively to two buffers available to it. When the reading device has finished reading the buffer is swapped with the buffer that was last written to and the process is continued. This methodology is generally used in graphics processing where the graphics processor is the writing device and the display device is the reading device.
