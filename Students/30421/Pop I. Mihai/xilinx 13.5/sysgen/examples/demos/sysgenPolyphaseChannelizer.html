<p>
The Polyphase Channelizer is an efficient architecture to implement a multi-channel digital transmitter to generate a set of frequency division multiplexed (FDM) channels that are to exist in a single sampled data stream.This design demostrates how the Xilinx FIR Compiler can be used in conjunction with the Xilinx FFT Core to implement a polyphase channelizer for both a transmit and receive path.
</p>
<p>
The design demonstrates an 8 channel Polyphase channelizer with a channel sample rate of 200 kHz. Due to the nature of the Polyphase channelizer the carrier separation of the FDM input must be 200 kHz. The design generates 8 equally spaced frequency division multiplexed (FDM) channels from 8 individual baseband channels. The 8 FDM channels are then down converted back to 8 individual baseband channels.
