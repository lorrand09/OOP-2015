<b>Double Buffer</b>
<p>
This design shows how to create a generic double data buffer using SysGen External Memory Interface simulation model block based on the VDMA IP behaviour. The design behaves similarly to a Dual Port RAM with two read , write data ports and some simple control I/O ports.

<b>Design</b>
<p>
For this particular configuration, each buffer reads a complete frame of an input image file and stores it in the VDMA system memory. 
The same image is then transmitted via axi_stream_transmitter ports. At the top-level, the parameters are provided so you can configure the design to read and write different size of 2D images. 

Block Descriptors:

The VDMA can be configured to transfer multiple frames of data where each frame is a 2D data characterized by : 
START_ADDRESS : The Physical location in memory where the first Byte of the frame is read from or written to.
HSIZE : Number of horizontal bytes 
VSIZE : Number of vertical lines of transfer 
STRIDE : The address offset between the start byte in each line.

In this design, users can manipulate how and when to read the image stored in the VDMA system memory by modifying these two M-code files:
   -  xldScatterGatherEngineBlockTransfer_1.m for the first buffer channel
   -  xldScatterGatherEngineBlockTransfer_2.m for the second buffer channel
For example, to read from the first buffer , the START_ADDRESS will need to be set to zero. On the other hand, to read from the second buffer, the START_ADDRESS will need need to be offset  by the size of the first input image.  

Both buffers share the same M-code file (xlWriteControlRegister_db.m) to control data and address registers of the AXI VDMA operation.
