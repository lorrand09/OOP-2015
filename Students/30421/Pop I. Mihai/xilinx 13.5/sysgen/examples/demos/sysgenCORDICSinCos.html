<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">CORDIC-based sine and cosine function</font></h3>
<p>
This design implements a fully parallel CORDIC  (COordinate Rotation DIgital
Computer) algorithm in rotational mode that computes
the sine and cosine of the input angle z between +/- pi.
</p>
<p>
The CORDIC algorithm is attractive for an FPGA implementation because it
consists primarily of shift and add operations.  
An N-bit adder/subtractor  requiries only N/2 logic slices.  The CORDIC
subsystem is masked, and allows customization of bit precision, 
the number of processing elements (PEs) in the CORDIC engine and the ability to
pieline each individual stage.  With eight PEs, the design occupies 503 LUTs (49%), 
412 flip-flops (40%), and 272 slices (53%) of a Xilinx xc2v80-5 part. 
The maximum clock frequency is approximately 230.04 MHz (Device speed data version: 
PRODUCTION 1.121 2005-11-04, ISE 8.1i software, VHDL synthesized with XST).
