<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">LMS-based adaptive equalization (Synthesizable RTL)</font></h3>
<p>
This design shows how to use the MCode block to create fully
synthesizable register transfer level (RTL) designs in System
Generator.  The design was derived directly from the sysgenFSE.mdl
demonstration design, replacing non-RTL blocks by MCode block
equivalents.  RTL targets are particularly useful when single source
must target different FPGA families.

This design shows a T/2 adaptive Fractionally Spaced Equalizer (FSE) 
operating on a 16-QAM data source with noise and filtering introduced 
in the channel model.  Virtex-II dedicated multipliers 
are used in the complex multipliers blocks in order to provide high
speed and resource utilization of the FPGA device.  
<p>

The DHAT scope provides an X-Y plot of the I and Q filter outputs from 
within the FSE.  As the simulation progresses, these symbols will 
converge as the error is reduced.  The magnitude of the filter coefficients 
is shown in a vector scope as well.  Increasing the simulation duration 
will allow better visualization of the adaptive FSE effects on the filter
output.
