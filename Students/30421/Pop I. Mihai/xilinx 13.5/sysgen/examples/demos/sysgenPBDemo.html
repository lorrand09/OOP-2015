<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">PicoBlaze(Tm) Microcontroller</font></h3>
<p>
This model shows how to debug a design containing
the PicoBlaze(tm) microcontroller.  The debugging tools
allow simulations to single-step or run continuously,
display microcontroller internals, and show which
instruction is being executed at the moment.
<p>
To make the simulation run continuously, flip the switch
driving "Single-Step Simulation"  up; when the switch
is up, the simulation pauses after every clock cycle.
Note each microcontroller instruction takes two cycles.
The block named "PicoBlaze Instruction Display" shows
which instruction is executing at the moment.  The
microcontroller itself is inside the subsystem named
"Microcontroller Subsystem".  Turning on the
microcontroller's  "Display Microcontroller Internals"
checkbox causes internal values to be made visible.
<p>
The single step simulation and instruction display blocks
can be used in any model that includes a PicoBlaze(tm)
microcontroller - simply copy the blocks into the model.
