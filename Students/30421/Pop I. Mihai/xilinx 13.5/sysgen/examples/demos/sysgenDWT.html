<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">2D DWT filter</font></h3>
<p>
The test bench for this wavelet design consists of a processor (built with the
Xilinx Blockset for implementation in a Spartan-II
FPGA) and behavioral models for a pair of external, dual-port memories.  The two
memories are initialized with the pixel values
of a grayscale image.  The pixels from the initial image are interleaved into
the two banks in a column first indexing strategy.
If the image contained a checkerboard of black and white pixels, then all of the
black pixels will end up in the one bank, and all of 
the white pixels in the other.  The processor includes a memory controller that
schedules the reads and writes to memory, and
an image processing filter kernel that computes the 2D DWT decomposition of the
image.  The processor has been configured
to compute two levels of decomposition on a 64 x 64 pixel image. The computation
is done "in place" in the single image memory
space, and the initial pixel ordering is preserved throughout.

<p>
The design occupies 348 LUTs (22%), 478 flip-flops (31%), and 317 slices (41%) 
of an xc2s50-5 and runs at 160.26 MHz (processing 320 MPixels per second) in an 
xc2s50-5, a low-cost, high-volume, Spartan-II device. 
(Device speed data version: PRODUCTION 1.27 2005-11-04, ISE 8.1i software, 
VHDL synthesized with XST).

<p>
A full color version of the design would easily fit in the same part as only the
DWT datapath would require replication (the memory control could remain unchanged).
