<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">MCode-Based Fibonacci Number Generator</font></h3>
<p>
This design implements a Fibonacci number generator in an MCode block.
That is, given a non-negative integer n, it computes the  
recursively defined sequence x_0 = 1, x_1 = 1, ... , n_n = x_{n-2} + x_{n-1}.
<p>
This design should be compared to sysgenFIBONACCI_logic which
implements the same computation in a more hardware-centric way. 
The m-code implementing the MCode block is written so as to be as
close as possible to the logic in sysgenFIBONACCI_logic.  It is instructional  
to look at the m-code to learn how to implement an efficient MCode block.
<p>
The two designs are functionally equivalent, and use the same amount of FPGA resources.
<p>
For correctness of the design in practice, all the I/O gateways should
be double buffered.  This design does not do this for simplicity. 
The comparison of the logic design and the MCode design is simpler
without the double buffering.
