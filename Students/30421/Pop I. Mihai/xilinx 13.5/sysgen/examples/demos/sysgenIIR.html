<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">Multi-channel, folded implementation</font></h3>
<p>
This design demonstrates how multiple IIR filters can be implemented using a
single time-shared second-order section (biquad).  Specifically, 
15 distinct IIR filters, each consisting of four cascaded biquads, are realized
in a "folded" architecture that uses a single hardware biquad.  
Hardware folding is a technique to time-multiplex many algorithm operations onto
a single functional unit (e.g. adder, multiplier).   For low 
sample rate applications like audio and control, the required silicon area can
be much reduced by time-sharing the hardware resources.
</p>
<p>
In this design, the several individual folding techniques are employed:
</p>
<p>
<li>the biquad is time-multiplexed among fifteen channels
<li>the biquad is time-multiplexed among four cascade stages for each channel  
<li>the biquad is implemented using two multipliers and a single adder instead of the straightforward 5 multipliers and 4 adders (a biquad output is calculated in every 5 system clock cycles).
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The maximum clock frequency for the top-level design as shown is approximately
50 MHz.  The speed for each channel (4-cascade-stage 
IIR filter) is 50 MHz / (15 channels*4 biquads/channel*5 clks/biquad) = 166 KHz.
</p>
<p>
This design occupies 630 LUTs (20%), 211 flip-flops (6%), and 361 slices (23%),
7 Block RAMs (29%), and 8 VirtexII dedicated multipliers (33%) of an xc2v250-6 part 
and runs at 71.26 MHz (Device speed data version: PRODUCTION 1.121 2005-11-04, 
ISE 8.1i software, VHDL synthesized with XST).
