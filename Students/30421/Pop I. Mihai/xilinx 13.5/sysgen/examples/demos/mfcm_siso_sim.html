<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">SISO Channel Model Simulation
</font></h3>

<p>
This design demonstrates a Single Input-Single Output (SISO) channel model. 
The model parameters are obtained from 3GPP Technical Specification 25.104 
Annex B.2, multi-path fading propagation conditions (Case 4).

<p>
The output scope shows the channel response. Notice that the channel exhibits
both fast and slow fading.
