<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">LMS-based adaptive equalization</font></h3>
<p>
This design shows a T/2 adaptive Fractionally Space Equalizer (FSE) 
operating on a 16-QAM data source with noise and filtering introduced 
in the channel model.  The two 4-tap FIR filters are based on an 
SRL16E-based MAC implementation.  Virtex-II dedicated multipliers 
are used in the complex multipliers blocks in order to provide optimal 
speed and resource utilization of the FPGA device.  
</p>
<p>
The DHAT scope provides an X-Y plot of the I and Q filter outputs from 
within the FSE.  As the simulation progresses, these symbols will 
converge as the error is reduced.  The magnitude of the filter coefficients 
is shown in a vector scope as well.  Increasing the simulation duration 
will allow better visualization of the adaptive FSE effects on the filter
output.
</p>
<p>
The design occupies 1940 LUTs (12%), 1643 flip-flops (10%), 1419 slices (18%), 
and 16 dedicated multipliers (33%) of a Xilinx  xc2v1500-5 part. 
The maximum clock frequency is approximately 102.54 MHz 
(Device speed data version: PRODUCTION 1.121 2005-11-04, ISE 8.1i software, 
VHDL synthesized with XST).
