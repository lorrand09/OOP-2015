<h3><font size=+1 color="#990000">Polyphase 1:8 filter using SRL16Es</font></h3>
<p>
This design shows how a 128-tap 1:8 polyphase FIR filter can be can be
realized efficiently inside System Generator.  Three tricks are employed 
to make best use of hardware:
</p>
<p>
<li>Even coefficient symmetry reduces the number of MAC engines to 4;</li>
<li>Engines are built from SRL16E shift registers;</li>
<li>Virtex II 18x18 dedicated multipliers are used.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The impulse response of the filter is displayed in the output scope
during simulation.
</p>
<p>
The Simulink system sample period is set to 1 in the System Generator
token, and the sample period of the 'filter in' gateway is 32.  This means 
a new sample is presented to the filter every 32 system clock cycles.  
The filter interpolates 8 to 1, so a new filter output is produced every 4 
system clock cycles.
</p>
<p>
The registers that precede and follow the RRC Filter subsystem are
mapped into IOBs, and are used to obtain accurate performance numbers.
</p>
<p>
The design occupies 370 LUTs (12%), 421 flip-flops (13%), 272 slices (17%), 
and 4 dedicated multipliers (16%) of a Xilinx xc2v250-6 part.  
The maximum clock frequency is approximately 244.56 MHz 
(Device speed data version: PRODUCTION 1.121 2005-11-04, ISE 8.1i software, 
VHDL synthesized with XST).
