<b>Giant Fifo</b>
<p>
This design shows how an External Memory can be used as a Fifo for linear data using the VDMA Interface.The VDMA Interface is a simulation only block and the block transforms into top level Gateway Ins and Gateway Outs on netlisting. Further use of the design requires stitching it with VDMA IP available in Xilinx Platform Studio.
</p>
<b>Block Use</b>
<p>
The design provides standard FIFO interface such as push, pop, empty and full, The VDMA interface is used to pass data to external memory for the FIFO and shows how the VDMA interface can also be used to store non-image/video data.
