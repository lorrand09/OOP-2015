<blockquote CLASS="Body">The Xilinx XtremeDSP Co-Simulation block can be
used in place of a Simulink subsystem that was compiled for XtremeDSP co-simulation.&nbsp;
During simulation, the block behaves exactly as the subsystem from which
it originated, except that the simulation data is processed in hardware
instead of software.&nbsp;
<p>The port interface of the co-simulation block will vary.&nbsp; When
a model is implemented for co-simulation, a new library is created that
contains a custom XtremeDSP hardware co-simulation block with ports that
match the gateway names (or port names if the subsystem is not the top
level) from the original model.&nbsp;
<p>The hardware co-simulation block interacts with the XtremeDSP development
kit board during a Simulink simulation.&nbsp; Simulation data that is written
to the input ports of the block are passed to the hardware by the block.&nbsp;
Conversely, when data is read from the co-simulation block's output ports,
the block reads the appropriate values from the hardware and drives them
on the output ports so they can be interpreted in Simulink.&nbsp; In addition,
the block automatically opens, configures, steps, and closes the development
kit board.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<ul>
<li CLASS="Bulleted">
Bit File Name: specifies the co-simulation FPGA configuration file for
the XtremeDSP development kit board.&nbsp; When a new co-simulation block
is instantiated during compilation, this parameter is automatically set
so that it points to the appropriate configuration file.&nbsp; You need
only adjust this parameter if the location of the configuration file changes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li CLASS="Bulleted">
Bus Type: allows you to choose the interface in which the Co-simulation
block communicates with the XtremeDSP development kit board during a Simulink
simulation.&nbsp; You may select between <i>PCI</i> and <i>USB</i> interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li CLASS="Bulleted">
Clock: users can select between <i>Single Stepped</i> and <i>Free Running</i>
clock sources.&nbsp; Selecting a <i>Single Stepped</i> clock allows the
block to step the board one clock cycle at a time.&nbsp; Each clock cycle
step corresponds to some duration of time in Simulink&nbsp;&nbsp; Using
this clock source ensures the behavior of the co-simulation hardware during
simulation will be bit and cycle accurate when compared to the simulation
behavior of the subsystem from which it originated.&nbsp; Sometimes single
stepping is not necessary and the board can be run with a <i>Free Running</i>
clock.&nbsp; In this case, the board will operate asynchronously to the
Simulink simulation. Users can also select <i>Select from Inport</i> to
expose an optional port on the co-simulation block that allows selection
of the clocking mode during simulation. This port must be driven by a Boolean
signal, where a 0 selects single-step clock mode, and 1 selects free-running
mode.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li CLASS="Bulleted">
Free Running Clock Frequency (MHz): if <i>Free Running</i> clock is selected,
you may specify the operating frequency that the free running clock should
be programmed to run at during simulation.&nbsp; The selected clock frequency
will be rounded to the nearest valid frequency available from the programmable
oscillator.&nbsp; <i>Note:&nbsp; You must take care to specify a frequency
that does not exceed the maximum operating frequency of the model's FPGA
implementation</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valid operating frequencies of the
programmable oscillator are listed below:</li>

<div CLASS="Bulleted">&nbsp;
<br>20 MHz; 25 MHz; 30 MHz; 33.33 MHz; 40 MHz; 45 MHz; 50 MHz; 60 MHz;
66.66 MHz; 70 MHz; 75 MHz; 80 MHz; 90 MHz; 100 MHz; 120 MHz.</div>
</ul>

<ul>
<li CLASS="Bulleted">
Internal Block Period: specifies the duration of Simulink time that corresponds
to one clock cycle in the co-simulation hardware.&nbsp; Normally, the block
will automatically compute this time by analyzing the sample periods of
its input ports.&nbsp; When a co-simulation block is created during compilation,
this parameter is set to the <i>Simulink System Period</i> value from the
System Generator GUI in the model from which the co-simulation block was
derived.&nbsp; This value will normally be sufficient, however, you can
adjust the parameter if necessary if the block is used in a model with
port rates different from those in the original model.&nbsp; This parameter
is only visible when the block has no input ports.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li CLASS="Bulleted">
Port Signal Type: specifies the output signal type of the block's output
ports, either <i>Double</i> or the Xilinx fixed-point type, <i>XFIX</i>,
if the block has no input ports.&nbsp; If the block has at least one input
port, the block automatically sets its output port signal types to match
the input type (i.e., if the input ports are driven by <i>Doubles</i> the
output types will all be <i>Doubles</i>.&nbsp; This parameter is only visible
when the block has no input ports.</li>
