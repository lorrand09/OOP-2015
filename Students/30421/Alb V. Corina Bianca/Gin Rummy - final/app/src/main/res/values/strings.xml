    <string name="how_to_play">The objective in gin rummy is to score points and reach an agreed number of points or more
    , usually 100, before the opponent does.

    The basic game strategy is to improve one\'s hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin
    has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3
    or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. e.g. 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not
    in any meld. Aces are considered low—they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of
    runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not). A player can form any combination of melds
    within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or both. A hand can contain three or
    fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.

    The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards—aces are scored at 1
    point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are
    not allowed; if a player has a 3-card set and a 3-card run sharing a common card, only one of
    the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.</string>
