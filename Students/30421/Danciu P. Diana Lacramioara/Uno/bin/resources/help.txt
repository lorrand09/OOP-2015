Start to play: 

To start a hand, seven cards are dealt out to each player,

and the top card of the deck is flipped over and set aside to begin
 
the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first,
 
unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card 

(see below). 



On a player's turn, he/she must do one of the following:

-play a card matching the discard in color, number or symbol

-play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card 

(see restriction below)

-draw the top card of the deck

If a player chooses to draw the top card of the deck, and that card
 
is playable (it matches the discard, or is a playable wild card), then
 
the player may (but need not) immediately play that card.

Play proceeds clockwise around the table.



Action and Wild cards have the following effects:

Skip- Next player in sequence loses a turn

Draw Two- Next player in sequence draws two cards and loses a turn

Reverse- Order of play switches directions (clockwise to 

counterclockwise, and vice versa)

Wild- Player declares next color to be matched (may be used on any turn

even if the player has matching color)

Wild Draw Four- Player declares next color to be matched; next player 

draws four cards and discards the declared color.



A player may draw a card from the deck even if that player has a
 
playable card. If a player chooses to draw a card and the drawn card is

playable, the player has the option of either keeping it or playing it
 
immediately (as part of that turn).A player may play a Wild card at any

time (even if that player has other playable cards). A player who plays

his/her next-to-last card must call “UNO” as a warning to the others.



Penalties:

If a player lays down his/her next-to-last card without calling "uno" 

and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn (draws a
 
card from their hand, draws a card or touches the discard pile, 

depending on interpretation), he/she must draw 6 cards. 

If the player is not caught in time, or remembers to call "uno" before
 
being caught, he/she suffers no penalty.



Scoring: 

When a player is out of cards, he gets points for cards left in the

opponent's hands as follows:

All cards through 9 = Face value points

Draw 2 = 20 points

Reverse = 20 points

Skip = 20 points

Wild = 50 points

Wild Draw 4 = 50 points
