Hello,
I have to admit that for some unknown to me reason, the shots from aliens that I 
 much tried to randomize do not work properly. You will probably see for yourself 
that they somehow do not keep up with the aliens  and sometimes they 
randomly come out of nowhere. I tried a lot but did not manage to sove this issue.
I would very much appreciate to know and understand why .
